              Indian Music is probably the most complex musical system in the world with a very highly developed melodic and rhythmic structure. This (structure) includes complicated poly-rhythms, delicate nuances, ornamentations and microtones which are essential characteristics of Indian music. This makes it very difficult to notate every detail in Indian music.<br />
              <br />
              Originally Indian music was passed on by oral tradition (lit. Guru means teacher; shishya means student and parampara means tradition) from one generation to another for centuries. The music was never written down until much later. The notation system was actually developed much later more as a memory-aid than something from which to learn or something from which to perform. This is why the tradition wherein the student learns from a Guru on a &quot;one-on-one&quot; basis is considered to be the only real way to learn music since there are so many aspects that cannot be learned from a book because the existing notations are only a skeletal representation of the music.</td>

        <td class="runtext">Indian Music had its origins in the Vedas (4000 B. C. - 1000 B. C.) Four in number, the Vedas are the most sacred texts which contain about a thousand hymns. They were used to preserve a body of poetry, invocations and mythology in the form of sacrificial chants dedicated to the Gods. Great care was taken to preserve the text, which was passed down by oral tradition, so much so that both the text and the rituals remain unchanged to this day. The literature of the Vedas is divided into four parts: the Rig Veda, the Sama Veda, the Yajur Veda and the Atharva Veda. <br />
          <br />
          The oldest, the Rig, dates back to about 4000 B. C. It was recited, at first, in a monotone; it was later developed to three tones (one main tone, and two accents, one higher and the other lower called Udatta and Anudatta respectively.) This was done to accentuate the words since the text was of primary importance. The Yajur Veda which mainly consists of sacrificial formulas mentions the Veena as an accompaniment to vocal recitations during the sacrifices. By this time, the chants had evolved to two main notes with two accents forming the first concept of the tetrachord (four notes.)<br />
<br />

The <span class="disone">Sama Veda</span><span class="disone"></span> laid the foundation for Indian Music. The origin of Indian Music can be traced back to this Veda. Three more notes were added to the original tetrachord resulting in the first full scale of seven notes; within this scale were all the important and known musical intervals. The concept of the octave is also mentioned here.<br />
<br />

The <strong class="disone">Atharva Veda</strong> was a collection of formulas that deal with Black Magic and spells. The text of the Vedas is in Sanskrit, the classical language of India.<br />
<br />

The history of Indian music may be divided into the Ancient, Medieval and Modern periods.</td>

      <tr>
        <td class="runtext"><span class="dislink">The ancient period</span> originates with the Vedas and is followed by the Upanishads. Though the Upanishads are considered by some as the concluding portion of the Vedas or the Vedanta, they are in a class by themselves. Dating from 1000 - 300 B.C., they laid the foundations on which the philosophies and religions of India are based. It is in the Upanishads that the solfege system of seven notes is discussed. In the West, the solfege system was not developed until the tenth century A.D. by Guido of Arezzo. The period of the Epics, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata<span class="disone"> (500 B.C. - 200 A.D.)</span> saw the development of the Jati system on which the modern Raga system is based. Also, various melodic and percussion instruments are mentioned during this time. Mention must be made of the Natyashastra, a treatise written by Bharata in 300 B.C. It is the most authoritative and ancient work on the classical science of music and dance. Another milestone in the development of Indian music is the Brihadesi whose author, Matanga, started a scientific classification of scales which was the basis for the later development of the seventy two Melakarta system (parent scales) by the great scholar Venkatamakhi. Narada, another scholar contemporary with Matanga, further defined Ragas, coded the microtones (Srutis) and gave them their twenty-two names.<br />
<br />


<span class="dislink">The medieval period</span> dates from approximately the fifth to the seventeenth centuries A.D. The Geeta Govinda and the Indian song of songs were composed during this period. The medieval poet Jayadeva was the first to introduce the concept of Chhanda Prabandha (verses set to rhythm in a uniform manner.) The text, in Sanskrit, consists of beautiful songs dealing with the RadhaKrishna theme - thus, it is of religious and musical importance. Jayadeva's songs, known as Ashtapadi are still sung today though the melodies may vary.<br />
<br />

The Sangeeta Ratnakara, another treatise by the great composer and musician Sarangadeva, deals with the classification of Ragas according to the various seasons and different times of the day and the importance of certain notes in the delineation of the Raga <span class="disone">(Vadi and Samvadi)</span><br />
<br />

During the twelfth and thirteenth centuries northern India endured a series of invasions by Muslim rulers from Asia minor on a crusade to spread the Islamic religion throughout the region. Until this time, the history of Indian music remained the same for the whole of India. Following the Islamic invasions and the concurrent cultural amalgamation, Indian music developed two distinctive systems: North Indian music <span class="disone">(Hindustani music)</span> and South Indian music (Karnatic or Carnatic music.) The influence of Islam together with other cultural, social and political forces produced the unique Hindustani (literally, the music of India - Hindustan is the Hindi word for India, Stan translates as land of the Hindus) style. In South India music continued to develop without external influence and is still known today as Karnatic (literally - in Tamil - old or traditional).<br />
<br />

<span class="dislink">The modern period</span> (seventeenth century A.D. to the present) unfolds as a result of the efforts of individuals. Other than Venkatamakhi, the scholar who devised the system of seventy two Melakartas (parent scales from which thousands of Ragas are derived), three composers, known today as the musical trinity, worked and flourished, (Tyagaraja - 1767-1847; Muttuswamy Dikshitar - 1776-1835 and Syama Sastri - 1762-1827). Born in Tiruvarur all three were scholars of the scriptures and sacred literature.</td>
