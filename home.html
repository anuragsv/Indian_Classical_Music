            The origins of Indian classical music can be found in the Vedas, which are the oldest scriptures in the Hindu tradition. Indian classical music has also been significantly influenced by, or syncretised with, Indian folk music and Persian music. The Samaveda, one of the four Vedas, describes music at length. <br />
            <br />
			The Samaveda was derived from the Rigveda so that its hymns could be sung as Samagana. These hymns were sung by Udgatar priests at sacrifices in which the Soma ritual drink, clarified and mixed with milk and other ingredients, was offered in libation to various deities. <br />
            <br />
			This style evolved into jatis and eventually into ragas. Bharat's Natyashastra was the first treatise laying down fundamental principles of dance, music, and drama.</td>

            Indian music originated from the Vedas (4000 - 1000 B.C.). Four in number, the Vedas are the most sacred texts which contain about a thousand hymns.<br />
            <br />
			Music evolved from these hymns and the music was common throughout the length and breadth of India until about the 12th century. During this time, due to external influences of the Muslim rulers that invaded India from the Northwest, the music in the North underwent several changes whereas the music in the South continued to develop along the same lines without any external influence. <br />
            <br />
			This resulted in the birth of two distinct systems of music: Karnatic or South Indian and Hindustani or North Indian. Despite the fact that they have the same roots and have several concepts that are common, they are distinctly different and unique in their own ways.</span></td>

			<td height="15" align="left" valign="middle"><span class="runtext"><span class="title01">Important Concepts in Indian Music</span><br />
			Raga is often described as a scale or a mode. This is an incomplete definition of the Raga. Though it is based on a scale, the concept of the Raga is more complex. Verses in the old treatises of music describe a Raga as that which gives pleasure to the mind of the listener. <br />
			<br />
			Every Raga has its own definite characteristics which make it easy for a discerning listener to recognize. Based on a scale of five, six, or seven notes, the Raga has special features such as melodic ornamentations (gamakas) and microtones. <br />
			<br />
			Importance is given to certain notes (Vadi and Samvadi). The Vadi is the most important note used in the Raga and is usually one of the notes in the first tetrachord, whereas the Samvadi is the second most important note in the Raga and is in the second tetrachord. There are Ragas for different times of the day, occasions, and seasons.</span></td>
